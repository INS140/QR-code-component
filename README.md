## Overview

This is a challenge that I acepted from the Frontend Mentor website. I believe that this is the final version of my solution,
however I understand I am still new and could probably use some pointers. I am very happy that I took the time to do this project,
it has taught me a lot about the logistics of creating well-designed websites.

## My process

I was taught to always start with HTML first, having the bones of the website is the most important part.
Next I assigned classes and ID's as necessary and worked to slowly flesh out the CSS of the document.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

My biggest hurdle was trying to figure out how to center the <div> element itself and not just the text inside.
W3schools had the answer, it just took some searching to find.

```css
.container {
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - The absolute best resource for anything CSS. It has been an absolutely invaluable resource during my studies.
